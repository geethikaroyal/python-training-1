problem:
you are given two strings a and b . your task is to find and return a string representing the leftover string in a after removing all the latters that exist in string b. return "empty" if the output does not contain any value.
solution:
def cupcakes(n,arr):
    sum=0
    for i in range(n):
      if arr[i]>=5:
         sum+=arr[i]
    print(sum)
n=5
arr=[1,2,5,8,3,7]
cupcakes(n,arr)
